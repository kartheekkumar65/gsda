This code is a demo to show STDA can outperform the LDA and FC+LDA for ERP classification in small sample size scenario.

Note: This demo requires the tensor_toolbox developed by Kolda that can be download at:
(http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.5.html)

To see the results, you just run the m file titled "STDAforERPBCI_Demo".

More details about the STDA for ERP classification can be found in paper:
